**********************************************************I will make a "FACE RECOGNITION" project.****************************************************************

-> With this project we can keep all the details of the employees.

-> And also we can take the present of the employee from the Facial Recognition System.

-> A face recognition attendance system makes use of facial recognition technology to identify and verify a person and mark attendance automatically.

-> Fingerprint scanning systems are almost the standard for attendance systems but recent struggle with the pandemic has brought forth the issue with systems that        require physical contact. A facial recognition attendance system is a contactless technology that provides freedom from any physical interaction between the man        and the machine.

-> employees is still burdened by a manual attendance system. We should think something for them and make their work easy.



************************************************************FEATURES OF MY FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM********************************************************************

1. Automated Time Tracking System
--> Entry and exit time monitoring done manually or with other biometric systems can be fully automated with facial recognition attendance systems. There is no need for human intervention or physical validation as the system’s advanced algorithms can locate and identify faces autonomously. It is effortless to track time for employees with facial recognition.

2. Facial Recognition With Ageing Changes and Accessories
--> Face recognition attendance systems are not dependent on a few facial features but they are highly robust and identify a face on several data points. 
--> Therefore, these systems can screen for face masks and identify people without removing the mask or any change of facial attributes like beard, specs etc. 
--> It is a major advantage over any other biometric system as employees don’t have to take off their masks. 
--> Modern-day attendance systems use highly accurate face recognition algorithms that can also track changes in facial attributes like glasses, beards, hats, etc.

3. More Accurate and Better Worker Attendance
--> With a face recognition attendance system, the entire environment is automated. You won’t just take the attendance but also automatically record the entry-exit time of the employees.
--> It also adds to the security of the workplace as the system can recognize who left the designated area and when accurately.

4. Easy To Manage
--> As compared to manual attendance systems, AI-based attendance systems are highly automated.
--> These systems store and update day-to-day records in real-time.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


-> Face recognition attendance systems are modern utilities that are a requirement of even the post-pandemic era. 

-> These systems make employees’ attendance tracking accurate while saving costs. 

-> Such a system also adds a layer of security in the workplace. 

-> Facial recognition systems are the best modern-day solution for tracking employee hours.

-> Almost every big tech company including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Cisco is leading the effort to make face recognition more mainstream.
